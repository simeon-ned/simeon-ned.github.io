## Fundamental theorem of calculus

Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$. Let $F$ be the function defined, for all $x$ in $[a, b]$, by $F(x)=\int _{a}^{x}f(t)\,dt.$
Then $F$ is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and $F'(x)=f(x)$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$ so $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$

Theorems are cross-referable as @thm-calculus. 

There are a number of theorem variations supported, each with their own label prefix: lemmas are `#lem`, proposition are `#prp` etc, [read more](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs)
